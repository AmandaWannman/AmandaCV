# Amanda WÃ¤nnman Portfolio

This is where I sell myself. I have created a site with a portfolio where potential employers can find my publications, find information about me and my career as a marine biologist as well as my skills. It includes a section with my contact information as well as a form which can be used directly via the portfoilo.
